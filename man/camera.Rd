}
\arguments{
\item{eye}{A numeric vector of length 3 giving the position of the camera.}

\item{center}{A numeric vector of length 3 giving the position where the camera is looking at.}

\item{up}{A numeric vector of length 3 giving the direction of the "up" vector for the camera.}

\item{fovy}{A numeric scalar giving the field of view in radians.}

\item{aspect}{A numeric scalar giving the aspect ratio.}

\item{near}{A numeric scalar giving the distance to the near plane.}

\item{far}{A numeric scalar giving the distance to the far plane.}

\item{width, height}{A numeric scalar giving the width and height of the viewport.}

\item{ox, oy}{A numeric scalar giving the offset of the viewport in pixels.}
