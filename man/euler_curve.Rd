\title{Generate an Euler spiral or biarc curve between two oriented points}
\usage{
euler_curve(
  start = c(0, 0, pi/4),
  end = c(25, 10, pi),
  max_n = 100,
  max_iter_num = 1000,
  biarch = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{A numeric vector of length 3
specifying the starting point and heading direction:
\code{c(x, y, theta)}, where \code{theta} is the orientation angle in radians.}

\item{end}{A numeric vector of length 3
specifying the goal point and heading direction:
\code{c(x, y, theta)}, where \code{theta} is the orientation angle in radians.}

\item{max_n}{Maximum number of points to sample along the curve.}

\item{max_iter_num}{Maximum number of iterations
used in the internal parameter estimation algorithm
(used only when \code{biarch = FALSE}).}

\item{biarch}{Logical; if \code{TRUE},
use a biarc approximation consisting of two Euler spiral segments.
If \code{FALSE}, compute a single spiral curve via numerical estimation.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{theta},
giving the sampled positions and orientations along the generated curve.
If the parameter estimation fails,
the returned data may contain missing values, which are automatically removed.
}
\description{
Computes a planar curve connecting two points,
each with a specified orientation angle.
Two methods are available: a single Euler spiral, or a biarc composed of two spiral segments.
}
\details{
When \code{biarch = TRUE}, the curve is constructed from two spiral segments computed using
an internal algorithm that attempts to connect the start and goal points with \( G^1 \) continuity.
This approach may be more robust in cases where a single spiral does not converge well.

When \code{biarch = FALSE}, the function attempts to compute a single Euler spiral that smoothly
interpolates between the two endpoints and their respective directions. This may fail to converge
in some configurations.
