\title{Generate a human-like mouse movement path}
\usage{
wind_mouse(
  start = c(0, 0),
  end = c(100, 100),
  mouse_speed = 3,
  gravity = 9,
  wind = 3,
  min_wait = 5,
  max_wait = 15,
  max_step = 10,
  target_area = 10,
  seed = sample.int(10000, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the starting coordinates (x, y).}

\item{end}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the target coordinates (x, y).}

\item{mouse_speed}{A base speed factor that affects the dynamics of movement.}

\item{gravity}{Controls the strength of "pull" toward the target.}

\item{wind}{Controls the random "wind-like" movement during the motion.}

\item{min_wait}{Minimum wait time (ms) per step, affects timestamp \code{t}.}

\item{max_wait}{Maximum wait time (ms) per step.}

\item{max_step}{Maximum movement length per iteration.}

\item{target_area}{Radius within which the movement slows down and stabilizes.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible paths.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: X coordinate of the cursor.
\item \code{y}: Y coordinate of the cursor.
\item \code{t}: Cumulative time in milliseconds since the start.
}
}
\description{
Simulates a human-like mouse movement trajectory between two points using a
physics-inspired algorithm with gravity, wind, and random waiting times.
}
\details{
This function generates a sequence of points resembling how a human might
move a mouse cursor from \code{start} to \code{end}.
It is a port from \href{https://github.com/arevi/wind-mouse}{arevi/wind-mouse}.

\examples{
path <- wind_mouse(start = c(0, 0), end = c(300, 200), seed = 123)
plot(path$x, path$y, type = "l", asp = 1, main = "WindMouse Path")
